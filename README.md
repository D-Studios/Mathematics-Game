# Mathematics-Game

At the beginning of the game, the program specifies how many groups are playing the game. Type in a number to create a specific amount of groups and click on the Enter button. Each group is assigned a letter and the assigning of letters goes in alphabetical order. For example, if there are four groups, the four groups would be named A, B, C and D respectively. If there were eight groups instead, the eight groups would be named A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I. After entering the amount of groups, many mathmathetical questions in a single-answer multiple choice format will show up. The first group to find the answer should take the PC and type in their group name and a number (1 is the answer is A, 2 if the answer is B, 3 if the answer is C, and 4 if the answer is D). For example, if group B picks C for an answer, the group should enter B3. There are ten questions in the game. By the end of the game, the scores for each group will be shown.
